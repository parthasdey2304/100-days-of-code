# 100-days-of-code
This is my repository where I would be practising coding for 100 days both for DSA and Development on alternative days!. 

## Day 1 (DSA)
It was my first day and I really was not sure as I had not made a proper roadmap of what to follow for coding for 100 days. So I started with Basic Questions in Java.
+ [Questions](https://github.com/parthasdey2304/100-days-of-code/blob/main/day_1)
+ [Palindrome Number](https://github.com/parthasdey2304/100-days-of-code/blob/main/day_1/palindrome_number.java)
+ [Armstrong Number](https://github.com/parthasdey2304/100-days-of-code/blob/main/day_1/armstrong_number.java)
+ [Automorphic Number](https://github.com/parthasdey2304/100-days-of-code/blob/main/day_1/automorphic_number.java)
+ [Prime Check](https://github.com/parthasdey2304/100-days-of-code/blob/main/day_1/prime_check.java)
+ [Special Number](https://github.com/parthasdey2304/100-days-of-code/blob/main/day_1/special_number.java)

## Day 2 (Development)
I am planning on improving my PortFolio Page [ParthaSarathiDey.tech](https://parthasarathidey.tech)
