# 100-days-of-code
This is my repository where I would be practising coding for 100 days both for DSA and Development on alternative days!. 

## Day 1 (DSA)
It was my first day and I really was not sure as I had not made a proper roadmap of what to follow for coding for 100 days. So I started with Basic Questions in Java.
+ [Questions](https://github.com/parthasdey2304/100-days-of-code/blob/main/day_1)
+ [Palindrome Number](https://github.com/parthasdey2304/100-days-of-code/blob/main/day_1/palindrome_number.java)
+ [Armstrong Number](https://github.com/parthasdey2304/100-days-of-code/blob/main/day_1/armstrong_number.java)
+ [Automorphic Number](https://github.com/parthasdey2304/100-days-of-code/blob/main/day_1/automorphic_number.java)
+ [Prime Check](https://github.com/parthasdey2304/100-days-of-code/blob/main/day_1/prime_check.java)
+ [Special Number](https://github.com/parthasdey2304/100-days-of-code/blob/main/day_1/special_number.java)

## Day 2 (Development)
I am planning on improving my PortFolio Page [ParthaSarathiDey.tech](https://parthasarathidey.tech)

## Day 3 (DSA)
I am planning on revising the basic DSA concepts of Recursion, Stack, Queue, LinkedList and Traversing through them.

## Day 4 (Development)
Well lets make a terminal basic music player app using Youtube Music's API.


## Day 5 (DSA)
Lets brush up the collection framework in java mainly the Hashmaps, ArrayList and LinkedList.

## Day 6 (Development)
Lets make update our PortFolio page by adding a little bit animations to it using GSAP ScrollTrigger and Locomotive.js.

## Day 7 (DSA)
Lets start solving basic easy level LeetCode questions. Lets try doing 5 questions today.

## Day 8 (Development)
Its been a while that I have been away from Web Development, lets brushup React.js concepts once.

## Day 9 (DSA)
Lets try solving some more LeetCode question of medium level preferably 3 questions.
